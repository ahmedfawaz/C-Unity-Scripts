# C-Unity-Scripts
All scripts created in C# for Unity projects

I'll be updating this repo as i go on and create new scripts for personal and professional use. Each folder has its own README to explain the usage in more depth than here. All scripts are being written with the latest Unity 5 and may or may not work in earlier versions.

## Features

- [TouchScreen Camera Scrubbing](TouchScreenCameraScrubbing) - Camera Scrubbing script that allow you to pre-define a camera path by animating it and manipulating it via scrubbing the touch screen.
