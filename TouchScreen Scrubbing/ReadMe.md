# TouchScreen Camera Scrubbing
Script was created using unity 2017.1.0p5


# Functionality:
This script allows you to drag your finger across the screen in X, -X direction. It will control the cameras animation, allowing you to control the cameras path.

### Note

The script was made to be used with a legacy animation gameobject set to "Calmp Forever". attach this script to your camera and plug-in your animated gameobject.

Huge Thank you to Zayed Upal for helping me create this script.
